4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
